            /*
                We could make a method to rotate angles as we do this so often.
                It is not straightforward however. If we put the rotation code in a
                method we would either have to put the below sine and cosine calculations
                in it which would make it slow or pre-compute them before the method call
                and the for loops which is kind of untidy in itself.

                Also if you consider that we need to more than one value for both sine
                and cosine of an angle, the method needs to 'know' which to use, which isn't rocket
                science but it starts to get even less compact than we might have initially imagined.

                So I opted for avoiding the method call altogether even if the code is a little sprawling.

                Actually if you place the whole lot in a method call you still get
                nearly 60 fps on an old Galaxy S2 phone. So if you want to tidy things
                up, go ahead; I just thought it was worth discussing why I did
                things this way.
